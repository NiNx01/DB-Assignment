### 1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities in the database is structured as a one-to-many relationship. This means that each product is associated with one specific product category, while a product category can have multiple products linked to it. This linkage is established through the utilization of a foreign key in the "Product" table. Specifically, the "category_id" column within the "Product" table references the primary key "id" column in the "Product_Category" table, facilitating the connection between products and their corresponding categories.

### 2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

To ensure that each product in the "product" table has a valid category assigned to it, the following steps can be implemented:

- **Database Constraints:** Use foreign key constraint on "category_id" column in "product" table referencing primary key "id" column in "product_category" table. This prevents the insertion of invalid category IDs into the "product" table.

- **Data Validation:** Validating "category_id" inputs against existing IDs in "product_category" table during product addition or updation, ensuring that only existing category IDs are assigned to products.

- **Front-end Interface:** Restrict user input to select or input only existing category IDs from "product_category" table. This prevents users from entering invalid category IDs and helps maintain data integrity.

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to detect and handle invalid "category_id" assignments.

- **Regular Data Audits:** Conduct periodic audits to identify and correct any inconsistencies between "product" and "product_category" tables.
